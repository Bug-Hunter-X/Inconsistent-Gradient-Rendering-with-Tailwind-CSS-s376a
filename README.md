# Inconsistent Gradient Rendering with Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradient utilities.  The `bg-gradient-to-r` utility, while generally reliable, can sometimes produce slightly different renderings across different browsers. This inconsistency is not always significant but might be noticeable in certain cases, especially with complex gradients or specific browser configurations.

## Bug Description

The primary issue involves variations in the rendering of linear gradients. The gradient might not perfectly align or show subtle color differences between browsers. This inconsistency may stem from browser-specific differences in gradient implementation or CSS rendering engines.

## Solution

The provided solution introduces a fallback mechanism, ensuring a consistent gradient appearance across different environments. It checks for browser-specific prefixes and adds the most appropriate vendor-prefixed gradient declaration.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Open `index.html` in various browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to observe the gradient rendering.
